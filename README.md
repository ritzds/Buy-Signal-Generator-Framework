# Buy-Signal-Generator-Framework
Developed an advanced Buy Signal Generator Framework to predict and generate buy signals for ETFs and S&amp;P 500 stocks. This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, algorithm development, and financial modeling, aimed at achieving optimal returns with controlled risk.

Key Highlights:

Objective and Design: Created a framework to predict and generate buy signals for short-term trading, focusing on market timing, risk management, capital utilization, and performance enhancement.

Data Collection and Analysis: Utilized Python to collect and analyze historical market data from the Yahoo Finance API. Conducted thorough data analysis to optimize parameters and improve model accuracy.

Technical Indicators: Implemented technical indicators such as moving averages, specifically the 9-day and 21-day moving averages, to determine buy signals based on defined parameters like Difference and Gap.

Model Development: Formulated and calibrated the model based on historical data from 2020-2022, ensuring robustness through out-of-sample testing and stress testing against market crashes.

Performance Metrics: Achieved a win rate of 57.14% and an average mean return of 2.0537%, validating the model's efficacy.

Risk Mitigation: Identified and addressed model risks such as single-sided signals, user input dependency, and overfitting. Enhanced the model by incorporating recommendations for user parameter inputs and potential integration of sentiment analysis.

Simulation and Testing: Simulated account growth using statistical distribution parameters, demonstrating the potential for substantial capital appreciation with an initial investment.

Continuous Improvement: Established a feedback loop for continuous model performance monitoring and updates, ensuring adaptability to changing market conditions.
